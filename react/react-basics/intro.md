PatternFly React is made up of components, layouts and demos.

The PatternFly React library provides a collection of React components used to build interfaces with consistent markup, styling, and behavior.  In this course, build a PatternFly card starting with content, add a header and action buttons and conclude by adding a card footer.

This tutorial will cover React, using PatternFly components to build a consistent experience, and using layouts to put components together.
