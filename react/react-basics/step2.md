Add content to the `CardBody` of the card.

1) <strong>Make sure the `App.js` file is still open.</strong>

2) <strong>Locate the `<CardBody>` component.</strong>

It will look like the following:

<pre class="file">
&lt;CardBody&gt;
&lt;/CardBody&gt;
</pre>

3) <strong>Add content to that section.</strong>

<pre class="file" data-target="clipboard">

</pre>

Once the preview reloads, it should look like this:
<img src="react-basics/assets/card-with-body.png" alt="Card with body content" style="box-shadow: rgba(3, 3, 3, 0.2) 0px 1.25px 2.5px 0px;" />
