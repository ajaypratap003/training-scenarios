In this scenario, you will learn how to use PatternFly 4 React Table for the first time.

Patternfly React tables are based on the [Reactabular.js](https://reactabular.js.org/) library, and extend it with additional functionality and custom components.

PatternFly React tables are composed using separate components and composable functions, so features are more easily customizable. This course introduces you to the PatternFly table package - starting with a basic table component structure, defining simple rows/columns, converting simple row/column definitions into object form, and concluding by incorporating Pagination controls.
